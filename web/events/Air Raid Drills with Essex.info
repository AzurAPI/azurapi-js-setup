== Event Description ==
[[File:Air Raid Drills with Essex - Main Screen Start.png|500px]]

*In this event, Essex will be the boss and all the Commanders in the Server will need to work together to defeat Essex.
* Participating in the event will cost oil depending on fleet used but will not give any experience to ships.
*When the timer runs out, or your fleet is defeated, or the enemy is exhausted, contribution value will be given according to the total damage done.
*The battle will have a total time limit of 60 seconds. The higher the damage you cause, the  better rewards and contributions you will get. If you withdraw from battle, you will not receive any reward.
*Using the following ships will grant increased contribution points:
**[[Shangri-La]]: 20% more
**[[Independence]]: 10% more
*The event will be divided into multiple stages: 75%, 50%, 25%, and 0%. The lower the percentage, the stronger Essex will be.
*After it gets down to 0%, the enemy will get an "exhausted effect" and will do lower damage.
