*During the event, from the "Sparkling Battle Star" event banner you can play a mini game and earn a '''"San Diego Star"''' [[File:San_Diego_Star.png|28px]] by clearing it once a day. It can be replayed as much as you wish, but you can only obtain one star a day.
*The mini game is played by connecting 2 tiles of the same character together. This removes the connected tiles and the game is finished once all tiles have been cleared.
*The tiles are connected with a line which can only curve two times at most to reach its destination using the shortest route available. The line can only move horizontally and vertically. If the line needs to curve more than twice to reach its destination then the tiles cannot be connected.
*If you run out of possible connections to make and the game becomes impossible to complete then you can reset the position of the current tiles on the screen by tapping the circular red button in the top right corner. This will not restart the game or add more tiles, it will simply shift the location of the current tiles around so that it should be possible to complete the game.

*When you've cleared the mini game 7 times during daily reset and acquired '''18 "San Diego Stars"''' [[File:San_Diego_Star.png|28px]], you will acquire an item necessary for '''[[San Diego]]'s retrofit''': the "Sparkling Microphone"''' [[File:Sparkling_Microphone.png|28px|link=]].'''
