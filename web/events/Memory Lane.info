There's a couple of rules, so you may read them before you start to play this mini-game:
*'''Rule 1''': At daily reset every day, the  Memory Card [[File:Memorycard.png|25px]] reserve increases by 1, up to a maximum of 7 (10 for re-run).
*'''Rule 2''': All cards are shown at the start, then hidden. Tapping any card starts the timer and flips the card you tapped.
*'''Rule 2''': Now tap a second card to turn it over. Turning over 2 of the same card will solve the pair. A mismatched pair will un-flip both cards.
*'''Rule 3''': Once all pairs are solved, you will acquire 1 Memory Card [[File:Memorycard.png|25px]], and the reserve decreases by 1.
*'''Rule 4''': You can restart the game as much as you like, but will only receive a Memory Card [[File:Memorycard.png|25px]] if the reserve has any left.
*'''Rule 5''': When you have 7 (10 for re-run) Memory Cards [[File:Memorycard.png|25px]], you will exchange them for [[Houshou]]'s ''Autumn Dreams'' skin.
*'''Rule 6''': Your best time is recorded on the event banner.
