==Maps==

There are three maps for this event: SP1-SP3. Some tips:
*SP-1 mobs drop T3 Upgrade plates; at level 50, this makes the map the lowest overall level to farm for these plates.
*NB: At the current time the info for SP2 and SP3 is merely hypothesized; when the wiki staff have cleared the event maps needed to unlock these further maps, details will be updated. SP1 is updated.

==Tasks==

There is an animated quest chain for this event, similar to the [[Tanabata]] quest chain, as well as clear rewards for the maps (listed in the map template). They will be released once per day. '''Each Day, [[Yat Sen]] must be found in the [[Academy]], tapped, and the speech bubble tapped as well.''' There will be a notification on the academy screen if this is yet to be done for the day. The dialog box at the end of the screen takes the player to the tasks screen.

* Note: NPC Yat Sen will temporarily join your fleet for the final 3 tasks. This Yat Sen is at level 100, Max Limit Break, gives +2 max and starting ammunition, and does not consume fuel.
