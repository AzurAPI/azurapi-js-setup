==Maps==

There are three maps for this event: SP1-SP3. Some tips:
*SP-1 mobs drop T3 Upgrade plates; at level 50, this makes the map the lowest overall level to farm for these plates.
*[[Houshou]] can be farmed on SP-3.

==Tasks==

There is an animated quest chain for this event, similar to the [[Akashi]] quest chain, as well as clear rewards for the maps (listed in the map template). They will be released once per day. '''Each Day, [[Houshou]] must be found in the academy, tapped, and the speech bubble tapped as well.''' The dialog box at the end of the screen takes the player to the tasks screen.

In addition to these two, there are a few additional things worth mentioning:

*There is a limited-time [[Erebus]] skin ('Unreal Happiness') available for purchase.
*A limited-time, event only furniture set, 'Painting Classroom,' will be available in the backyard.
