[[File:Popularity Poll 2019 Voting Confirmation EN.png|thumb|Voting Confirmation Overlay|400px|link=]]
By clearing [[Campaign]] maps and SOS missions '''"Support Points"''' [[File:vote_pt.png|25px|Support Point|link=]] can be received. After clearing a map, a "Voting Confirmation" minigame may appear and need to be completed. In this minigame, 7 random ship chibis (either facing left or right) will appear. You need to change the direction they are facing to match the direction indicated above by a Manjuu. The minigame does not have to be completed right after the map clear, but there is a ten minute timer. These "Support Points" [[File:vote_pt.png|25px|Support Point|link=]] are needed to progress in the [[#Ballot_Milestone|Ballot Milestone]].

The following amount of "Support Points" [[File:vote_pt.png|25px|Support Point|link=]] will drop:
