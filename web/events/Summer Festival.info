'''Note:''' You can play the minigames as often as you want, but you will not receive any rewards if you run out of Game Ticket. If you quit during a minigame, the Game Ticket will not be consumed, but you will not gain any prizes.

== Minigames ==
=== Shooting Game ===
[[File:Summer_Festival_Shooting_Game.png|300px|thumb|right|Shooting Game.]]

12 siren targets will appear across 18 possible spaces, use the movement joystick and the Fire button to shoot the targets down before the 12 seconds timer ends. Each Siren has a different point value. After shooting down a Siren it will disappear and the remaining targets will shuffle.

When the timer runs out, the game ends. Prizes are as follows:

* 35 or more points: Tier 1
* 25-34 points: Tier 2
* 10-24 points: Tier 3
* Less than 10 points: Booby

=== Fireworks Workshop ===
[[File:Summer_Festival_Fireworks_Workshop.png|300px|thumb|right|Fireworks Workshop.]]

In this minigame fireworks are made up of three components: Inner, Middle and Outer layer. Click on the colored Element Balls to add them to the circles. The chosen elements change the fireworks colors. After all three layers have been selected and filled you can click the Launch Fireworks button to use the fireworks you produced.

The Fill Gauge will move continuously. You will have three tries that will add a percentage to fill the horizontal prize bar at the right of the screen. 

* First Tier: 140% - 160%
* Second Tier: 120% - 140%
* Third Tier: 90% - 120%
* Everything else: Booby

=== Food Stalls ===
[[File:Summer_Festival_Food_Stalls.png|300px|thumb|right|Food Stalls.]]

This is a memory minigame. It arguably requires the least dexterity of the three minigames. Each game consists of a series of rounds, each of which has two stages:

# First, three different snacks will be shown for 5 seconds.
# Then, you must choose those three snacks in order from a list of nine snacks before a timer ends. This timer starts at 10 seconds at the beginning of the game; the time left at the end of each round is used for the next round.

After the timer ends, your performance in the round is evaluated, and you gain points and bonus time according to how many of the snacks you selected correctly:

* 3 snacks: 5 points, +5 seconds.
* 2 snacks: 2 points, +2 seconds.
* 1 snack: 1 point, +1 second.
* 0 snacks: Nothing.

When the timer runs out, the game ends. Prizes are as follows:

* 20 or more points: Tier 1
* 12-19 points: Tier 2
* 5-11 points: Tier 3
* 4 or less: Booby

== Shrine ==
[[File:Summer_Festival_Shrine.png|300px|thumb|right|Summer Festival shrine.]]

After receiving a '''Shrine Visit''' by spending a Game Ticket on one of the minigames you can donate 5 Coins {{coin}} and select one of three blessings:
* [[File:buff_minigame_10.png|25px|link=]] Academic Achievement: Reduces training time in the [[Living_Area#Tactical_Class|Tactical Class]] by 3%.
* [[File:buff_minigame_11.png|25px|link=]] Career Success: Increases damage dealt by 5% while sortieing in a [[Campaign]], [[Hard Mode]], or [[War Archives]] map.
* [[File:buff_minigame_12.png|25px|link=]] Marital Bliss: Increases Affection gain rate of the secretary ship to 2 Affection points per 6 hours.
The blessing will be active for a duration of 24 hours. You can only have one blessing active at the same time. If you activate a new blessing while another one is still active, it will be replaced by the new one and the duration will be reset to 24 hours. 

'''Warning:''' While you can donate 5 Coins {{coin}} as often as you want, your prayers will not be heard if you don't have Shrine Visits available and you won't receive a new blessing.
