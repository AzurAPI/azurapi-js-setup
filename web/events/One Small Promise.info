The event consists of different 7 stages. After completing each stage for the first time, you will receive one ''"U-556 Medal"'' [[File:U-556 Badge.png|30px]]. After obtaining all 7 medals, you earn the limited equipment [[Unfulfilled Promise]].
In each stage, U-556 uses torpedoes, stealth, and a speed boost to travel safely past enemy destroyers. At the end of each map, you must have torpedoes saved to destroy an enemy cargo ship. Destroying the cargo ship clears the stage. One new stage unlocks every day. Stages can be repeated, but no additional reward is granted.

== Event Tasks ==
*There are no event tasks to be aware of beyond completing each new stage as they unlock. The event can be accessed from the home screen through the event icon or event banner.

The following is some general information about the special stages. See the above image for numbered reference.

1. '''Launch Torpedo''' - U-556 has 10 torpedoes at her disposal, these do not recharge. Once all 10 are fired, you are out of torpedoes. Fires one at a time. Takes 2 torpedoes to sink an enemy destroyer. 1 to sink the cargo ship at the end. If an enemy ship is sunk by torpedoes, surrounding ships will generate a small amount of alert (!).

2. '''Submerge / Surface (Recharge ~2s)''' - Switch between submerged / surfaced. When underwater, U-556 will not attract the attention of enemy ships while outside the search radius of enemy sonar. When surfaced, U-556 can move faster and enemy ships will slowly build up the alert meter (item 4). U-556 can remain underwater for 20s. When above water, U-556 will recharge oxygen, going from 0% to 100% in ~5s.

3. '''Boost (Recharge 15s)''' - U-556 will boost forward, good for traveling through enemy sonar or re-positioning quickly. 

4. '''Enemy ships''' - Enemy ships spawn in formations and move left toward U-556. Attacking, traveling within sonar range, or surfacing will generate alert. When ships reach full alert, the orange bar above them will fill to max (see ships on left), and they will launch depth charges at U-556 if U-556 is submerged. If U-556 is surfaced, enemies will shoot at her instead. Enemy ships can have 4 different types of alert icon above them, each impacting how the ship acts:

*'''No Icon''': Ships haven't detected U-556.
*'''?''': Ships are wary of U-556. Does not build alert. Surfacing without hostile action will put enemy ships into a (?) state. If you are spotted and submerge, ships will eventually transition from (!) to (?) and the alert meter will decrease.
*'''!''': Ships have spotted U-556. Builds alert. Staying surfaced for too long, attacking enemy ships with torpedoes, or traveling within sonar range will cause enemy ships to have a (!) status.
*'''!!''': Ships have spotted U-556 and are attacking. When the alert meter reaches full, ships will change to a (!!) status and begin to attack U-556 with depth charges and guns, sinking U-556 quickly. After ~8 seconds of U-556 taking no hostile actions, ships may reduce from (!!) to (!), and then to (?).

5A/5B. '''Naval Mines''' - Naval mines will spawn in patterns and "travel" toward U-556. 5A are ''submerged mines'', these mines will detonate if U-556 travels into them while being submerged. 5B mines are ''surface level mines'', these mines will detonate if U-556 travels into them while being surfaced. Mines can be destroyed with a single torpedo fired while surfaced or submerged.
