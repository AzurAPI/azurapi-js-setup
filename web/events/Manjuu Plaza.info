==Manjuu Misadventures==
Use Left, Right, and Jump buttons to control Saratoga and get her to higher Floors.  Falling from platforms, touching traps, or being caught by Angry Manjuus will deplete your Health.  The game ends when you have 0 Health.

There are three difficulty modes
{| class="azltable"
!Mode!!Dangers
|- 
|Easy||Falling
|-
|Normal||Falling, Traps
|- 
|Hard||Falling, Traps, Angry Manjuus, Clouds
|}

Playing Manjuu Misadventures while you have Credits will consume 1 Credit and reward you with 1 Check-in.  You do not need to score any points to receive the reward.

Get 7 Check-ins to earn the [[File:Invitiation.png|40px|link=]] Early Summer Invitation (2020), which can be used to Invite certain Super Rare ships.  The Invitation varies by server region.
