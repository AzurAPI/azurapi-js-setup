== Preparation Phase ==
* The preparation phase is available during the first seven days of the event.
* During this phase these ships will gain 20% more XP:
** [[Fortune]]
** [[Jean Bart]]
** [[L'Opiniâtre]]
** [[Le Temeraire]]

== Operation Phase ==
* The operation phase will be available once the preparation phase has ended and the associated event has started.
* This phase will feature several missions, some of which include the ships on the preparation phase, that rewards points.
* Once 3000 points is reached, a limited chat frame will be unlocked.
* '''Note:''' It is not required to clear all special missions to receive the limited chat frame.
* Assuming all clear missions are completed, a Fully Limit Break mission can be skipped for one Super Rare or two Elites.
